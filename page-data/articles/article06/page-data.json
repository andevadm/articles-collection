A typical article is around 400-500 words, and tools such as a WYSIWYG editor for writing and submitting an article may be provided.</p>\n<p>An author box may be provided for personal information about an author, including a link to the author's website.</p>\n<p>Tags or categories may be used to organize articles and to help with search engines since tags or categories act as keywords that identify the topics covered in the article. Many directories pay the author for his/her participation. Some directories review articles before they are published and there may be a waiting period of several days before a new article appears. This helps to eliminate low quality submissions, including duplicate articles, spam and spun articles. </p>\n<h3>Content farm</h3>\n<p>Articles in content farms have been found to contain identical passages across several media sources, leading to questions about the sites placing search engine optimization goals over factual relevance. Proponents of the content farms claim that from a business perspective, traditional journalism is inefficient.</p>\n<p>Content farms often commission their writers' work based on analysis of search engine queries that proponents represent as \"true market demand\", a feature that traditional journalism purportedly lacks.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Article Directory","description":"An article directory is a website with collections of articles written about different subjects.
