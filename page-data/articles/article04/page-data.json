Volume typically refers to the number of years the publication has been circulated, and issue refers to how many times that periodical has been published during that year. For example, the April 2011 publication of a monthly magazine first published in 2002 would be listed as, \"volume 10, issue 4\". Roman numerals are sometimes used in reference to the volume number.</p>\n<h3>Popular and scholarly</h3>\n<p>Periodicals are often classified as either popular or scholarly. Popular periodicals are usually magazines (e.g., Ebony and Esquire). Scholarly journals are most commonly found in libraries and databases. Examples are The Journal of Psychology and the Journal of Social Work.</p>\n<p>Trade magazines are also examples of periodicals. They are written for an audience of professionals in the world.
